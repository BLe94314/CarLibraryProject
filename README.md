This project has the user enter the owner operators credentials and attach each user ID to Car 1 & Car 2.
These cars are part of dealership car inventor that was recently purchased from a customer and the information being enter at the start of the code is the user that 
is purchase the car. The model and make of both cars are already pre defined. We intergrated required user inputs to the code in order to add dynamic functionality to the program.
